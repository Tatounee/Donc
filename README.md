# Donc
 
Clash of Clan players, have you ever asked the following question: What can my clan give me ?
Donc is the solution. It take a clan tag (*ex : #22Q992VQG*) a will give you a nice [csv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file with all the troops and spells that your clan mates can give you.
